**Note on the integrity of the data and future reuse of this data**:

https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db

The original OSRSbox datasets being used have not been updated since ~2020, weapons introduced to the game after that point only have partial data that I have retrieved from the wiki, they can be found in the `missing` JSON files. The new weapons `equipment` stats, `weapon` stats, and their `wiki_url` have been updated and are correct. The new weapons are using trivial or arbitrary item ids that are not official or used in game. Stats for older weapons being used in this project (if they are in the `filtered` JSON files) have also been updated if they were rebalanced after 2020.
